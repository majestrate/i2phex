This is a small guide how to create a private Network with Phex. 
It was originally written by Arne Babenhauserheide ( http://draketo.de )

What you need: 

- You must be able to build Phex from source 
    (if you're reading this, I assume you can). 
    
- You need either a dedicated GWebCache 
    (which I might explain at some other time) 
    or a host or a set of hosts which is/are permanently online 
    and reachable either via a static IP or via a dynamic DNS-address. 
    (This is what you'll use, if you follow these steps)
    
- You have to deploy customized Phex-jars or Programs 
    to the members of your group. 


How to begin: 

- Pick a network Name. 
    This is in some way your passcode. Without it, noone can enter your network. 

- Open src/phex/common/cfg.java and read in there, how to customize it further. 

- Ppen src/phex/resources/version.properties and set the 
    privatebuild.number to 01. 
    Increase it by 1 for every beta or stable release you make. 

- Open src/phex/resources/phex.hosts and replace any contents by a list of 
    your static hosts (static IP or dynamic dns-address). 
    One line for every adress. Only IP:Port or Hostname:Port. 

- Build the project (go into build and type ant, if you have ant installed, 
    else you have to find out how to get it yourself). 

- Give it to your peers and give them the address of your static hosts 
    (static IP or dyndns-adress). 
    This host is necessary for the first connection, later on 
    it should become obsolete, as soon as all programs have been deployed, 
    but only if your Private network is big enough, taht there are always 
    and at all times some people online. 
    Your peers should add these static hosts to their favourites 
    (in connections-view). 

- After the network ran for some time, when you want to deploy a new version, 
    copy the contents of [private-network-name]_phex.hosts from your 
    config-files ( in $HOME/.phex/ ) into src/phex/resources/ . 
    Then build the Program again. Now new members should be able to enter 
    the private network without always having to rely on the static host
    (but you should keep it online, just as safety. That bit of hassle you 
    avoid isn't worth angry or helpless users.)


I hope you are successful in creating your private network.
