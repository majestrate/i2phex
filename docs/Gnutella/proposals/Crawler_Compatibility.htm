<BODY><PRE>This document is a quick overview of how to best make your Gnutella 0.6 client 
crawler compatible with the LimeWire crawler.

Header Processing
-----------------

Upon a connection attempt, if you receive the header

    Crawler: majorversion.minorversion

respond with the headers

    Leaves: ipleaf1:port, ipleaf2:port, ...
    Peers: ippeer1:port, ippeer2:port, ...

After finishing the connection process, just close the connection.

The majorversion.minorversion of the crawler header is currently 0.1.

Leaves specify the ip and port of leaf nodes connected to your client if it is 
running as an ultrapeer.  Peers specify the non-leaf clients that you are 
connected to.  i.e. ultrapeers, 0.6 and 0.4 style clients.

Example:

       Crawler                          Client
       -----------------------------------------------------------
       GNUTELLA CONNECT/0.6<CR><LF>
       User-Agent: LimeWire (crawl)<CR><LF>
       X-Ultrapeer: False<CR><LF>
       Query-Routing: 0.1<CR><LF>
       Crawler: 0.1<CR><LF>
       <CR><LF>
                                        GNUTELLA/0.6 200 OK<CR><LF>
                                        User-Agent: BearShare<CR><LF>
                                        Leaves: 127.0.0.1:6346,127.0.0.2:6346,127.0.0.3:6346<CR><LF>
                                        Peers: 127.0.0.4:6346,127.0.0.5:6346,127.0.0.6:6346<CR><LF>
                                        <CR><LF>
       GNUTELLA/0.6 200 OK<CR><LF>
       <CR><LF>

       Disconnect                       Disconnect



This is the preferred method of delivering leaves and peers to the LimeWire 
crawler.  

The LimeWire crawler will currently wait 40 seconds before disconnecting.  In 
fact, it always attempts to employ the following backup algorithm.

Traditional Crawler Pings
-------------------------
In backup to the pure header only algorithm, the LimeWire crawler will 
establish the connection as above and then send a crawler ping with 
hop=0,TTL=2 and read your pong responses.  After sending the crawler ping, 
it also sends a network ping with hop=1, ttl=6 in an attempt to discover 
more hosts.  All pongs are processed.  Note that they should not be 
"Big" pongs with GGEP extensions.
