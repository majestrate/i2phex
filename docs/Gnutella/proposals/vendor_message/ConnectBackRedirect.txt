Dear GDF,
In an effort to make the UDP and TCP ConnectBack protocols more
accurate, LimeWire introduces the following two new Vendor Messages:

* TCP ConnectBack Redirect: LIME/7v1 (Payload: 6 bytes: 4 byte IP
Address, 2 byte LE port)
* UDP ConnectBack Redirect: LIME/8v1 (Payload: 6 bytes: 4 byte IP
Address, 2 byte LE port)

These messages should be forwarded from Ultrapeers that have received
a TCP/UDP ConnectBack request (from a Leaf) to another Ultrapeer that
supports the redirect message (as advertised in the MessagesSupported
Message). If no Ultrapeer that supports the new Redirect messages
exist, the Ultrapeer should simply perform the connect back itself (as
per the old protocol). The Ultrapeer should construct the new messages
by using a combination of data derived from the original ConnectBack
message and information about the Leaf it maintains (i.e. its IP
address).
An Ultrapeer that receives a Redirect message should try to connect
to the specified host assuming the following conditions are true: 1)
the Ultrapeer is not connected to the IP described in the Redirect
message and 2) the Ultrapeer has not tried to connect back to the IP
described by the Redirect message in the last 10 or so minutes.

This new protocol is necessary because some routers allow incoming
TCP/UDP connections from a host a computer behind the router has an
outgoing connection to. This sometimes results in a client thinking it
can accept incoming TCP/UDP connection when actually it can not. The
redirect mechanism is much more foolproof - it cannot make a mistake as
to whether a host can accept incoming TCP/UDP or not.

LimeWire currently has the 'server side' (support of redirect messages)
of this change in our current release (3.6.x). Our next version will
include 'client side' support (Ultrapeers will attempt to redirect
TCP/UDP ConnectBack requests to hosts that support redirect messages).

I welcome any comments/criticism.

Thanks!
Susheel
