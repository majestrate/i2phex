<H1>Tree Hash EXchange format (THEX)</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The following memo presents the Tree Hash Exchange (THEX) format, for 
  exchanging <B>Merkle Hash Trees</B> built up from the subrange digests of 
  discrete digital files. Such tree hash data structures assist in file 
  integrity verification, allowing arbitrary subranges of bytes to be verified 
  before the entire file has been received.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Description and references</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>To get the latest complete version of the THEX specification, visit:<BR><A 
  href="http://open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-thex-01.html"><B>http://open-content.net/specs/draft-jchapweske-thex-01.html</B></A></P>
  <P>THEX can be used to exchange Merkle Hash Trees computed with various 
  message digest algorithms and various digest sizes (including "CRC32", "MD5", 
  "SHA1" or "Tiger" with all their variants).</P>
  <P>Despite THEX trees built with CRC32 are very fast to compute and can detect 
  most errors in transmissions, they don't offer security against undesired 
  tampering of file contents. In addition, CRC32 tends to be too small for large 
  file contents where THEX is typically needed. So, stronger digest algorithms 
  with longer lengths are highly preferable.</P>
  <P>Most THEX applications will then use the 160-bit "SHA1" message digest 
  algorithm, or the faster and stronger 192-bit "Tiger" message digest 
  algorithm, as they are currently irreversible.</P>
  <P>It's possible to use reduced versions of these two message digests to 
  minimize the storage space used by serialized THEX tree data, but message 
  digests should generate at least 128 bits, each bit with approximately equal 
  encryption strength.</P>
  <P>The standard THEX tree data exchange format uses XML in its encapsulation 
  layer according to the Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (alias 
  <B>DIME</B>) specification used for XML Web Services, initially developed by 
  Henrik Frystik Nielsen, and developped as an IETF draft by Microsoft/IBM for 
  SOAP. Visit:<BR><A 
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/gxa/default.asp?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/dimeindex.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/understanding/gxa/default.asp?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/dimeindex.asp</A>)</P>
  <P>The THEX serialized tree data transported in a DIME encapsulation should be 
  accessible in a location independant way, for example the secure "urn:sha1:" 
  URN or very secure "urn:bitprint:" URN (both requires precomputing the digests 
  of the fully serialized tree), or a more simple "uuid:" URI defined in SOAP 
  and referenced in DIME (this UUID can be generated independantly of the 
  serialized tree data content, and may reduce the time to generate the DIME 
  encapsulation as it does not require an additional hash, but this makes THEX 
  serialized trees less secure).</P>
  <P>For some distributed applications (in peer-to-peer file exchange protocols 
  or distributed file systems), the THEX encapsulation in XML with DIME may be 
  unnecessary, if user-agents all agree on the message digest algorithm to use, 
  and on its tree data serialization format. In that case, only the tree data 
  URN may be necessary, and transported for example during connection handshake 
  headers (if using HTTP-like protocols that allow transporting such extensions 
  before the actual file content data). Note however that DIME allows further 
  extension to stronger or faster alternate algorithms if they become 
  necessary.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Applications of THEX for "TigerTree" file digests</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A typical application of Merkle Hash Trees is "TigerTree" which is another 
  file Digest that can complement "SHA1" file digests.</P>
  <P>A "TigerTree" digest <B>differs</B> from a full "Tiger" because it is NOT 
  computed by digesting the full file, but by combining "Tiger" digests computed 
  on individual 1KB blocks, and combining them in a Merkle Hash Tree. The 
  "TigerTree" digest of the file is the root hash of the Merkle Hash tree 
  computed with the standard "Tiger" digest.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Bitzi's "bitprint:" URNs and TigerTree file digests</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Bitzi's "bitprint:" URN scheme uses the "TigerTree" file digest, NOT 
  the "Tiger" file digest. They will most often be different for any file that 
  is larger than 1024-9=<B>1013</B> bytes exactly, and will always be identical 
  ONLY for small files up to 1013 bytes.</P>
  <P>"bitprint:" URNs can be computed without generating and serializing the 
  full Merkle Hash Tree. But for applications in Gnutella with swarmed 
  downloads, it's best to keep a storage for intermediate hash values, that 
  complies to the THEX binary serialization format.</P>
  <P>Note: Bitzi's "bitprint:" URN are using the following format:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"<B>urn:bitprint:</B><I>SHA1</I><B>.</B><I>TigerTree</I>"</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>where:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>"<B>urn:</B>" is NOT case significant (according to URI specification) 
    and designates the protocol format for Universal Resource Names that MUST be 
    <B>location-independant</B> (lowercase is strongly recommanded as the 
    canonical format); 
    <LI>"<B>bitprint:</B>" is NOT case significant (according to URN 
    specification) and designates the URN encoding scheme that SHOULD be 
    registered (lowercase is strongly recommanded as the canonical format, as 
    this URN scheme is not formally registered); 
    <LI>the rest of the string normally depends of the encoding and may 
    differentiate lowercase and uppercase letters, so a "canonical" 
    representation is needed to conform to the URN standard: 
    <UL>
      <LI>"<I>SHA1</I>" is the <B>Canonical Base32</B> encoding of the 160-bit 
      (20 bytes) "SHA1" digest of the full file, as a 32-characters ASCII 
      string; 
      <LI>"<I>TigerTree</I>" is the <B>Canonical Base32</B> encoding of the 
      192-bit (24 bytes) "TigerTree" digest of the full file, as a 39-characters 
      ASCII string; 
      <LI>(A Canonical Base32 string uses only <B>uppercase</B> ASCII letters 
      'A' to 'Z' to encode base 32 digit values 0 to 25, and ASCII digits '2' to 
      '7' to encode base 32 digit values 26 to 31. So servents MAY accept 
      lowercase letters as equivalent, but they SHOULD only generate uppercase 
      letters.) </LI></UL>
    <LI>The total length of a "urn:bitprint:" URI is exactly 3+1+8+1+32+1+39=85 
    characters </LI></UL>
  <P>Note: The shorter (but less secure) "sha1:" URN for any file content can be 
  simply infered from an existing "bitprint:" URN for the same file content by 
  replacing the URN encoding scheme, and stripping the "<B>.</B>" and the 
  <I>TigerTree</I> part. So transporting both the "sha1:" URN and the 
  "bitprint:" URN is not needed, as the latter will suffice in most cases.</P>

<H2>Applications of THEX for peer-to-peer file exchanges</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>THEX works best with peer-to-peer file exchanges and distributed 
  filesystems.</P>
  <P>The "swarmed downloads" feature on <B>Gnutella</B> will best benefit from 
  THEX as it allows verifying the integrity of files downloaded by fragments 
  from multiple sources, as discovered with the "<B>HUGE</B>" protocol extension 
  proposal for Gnutella that is largely approved by most Gnutella servent 
  vendors</P>
