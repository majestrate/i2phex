<h1>CVS Guideline</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This guide should collect conventions used in the Phex project when working with CVS. Every Phex developer working with CVS should try to follow this guide as good as possible.
<h2>Release</h2>
TODO --- Only the person creating the relase should modify the version.properties. ---
<h2>Tagging</h2>
<ul>
<li>A release is always tagged with the word "release" append with a "-" and its version. The version separator "." is replaced with a "_". Only the person who builds and publishes the release should place the release tag.<br>
<b>Example: release-0_8_0_34</b>
</ul>
<h2>Branching</h2>
<h3>Recommended Documentation:</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Procedure and Naming Guideline:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you plan to integrate bigger changes that you might not get finished and tested in a few days, you should think about creating a separate branch on which you can develop freely without influencing and getting influenced by other developers.<br>
<li>Before branching you should synchronize with the project leaders and other developers to agree about your intention and reason to create branch.
<li>The branch point should be selected carefully. Usually its only necessary
to branch of the /phex/src directory or of a specific package (e.g.: /phex/src/phex/gui) depending on what changes you plan to integrate.
<li>The name of a branch should be in lower case. Words should be separated by a "-". The name should end with the word "branch".<br>
<b>Example: xml-metadata-search-branch</b>
<li>Before creating a branch, a tag should be placed on the branch point. The name of the tag should be the branch name appended with the word "point".<br>
<b>Example: xml-metadata-search-branch-point</b>
<li>Before merging a branch back into the main line or into a different branch, a tag should be placed on the branch and on the line to merge into. The name of the tag should be the branch name appended with the word "before".<br>
<b>Example: xml-metadata-search-branch-before</b>
<li>After merging a branch back into the main line or into a different branch a tag should be placed on the line merged into. The name of the tag should be the branch name appended with the word "after".<br>
<b>Example: xml-metadata-search-branch-after</b>
</ul>
