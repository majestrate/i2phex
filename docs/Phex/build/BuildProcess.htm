<h1>The Phex Build Process</h1>
<h4>for Phex 0.8</h4>
<hr>
<h3>System Requirements</h3>
To build Phex you need to have a the following Products installed:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition Version 1.4 or higher</b><br>
    The Java 2 SDK is a development environment for building applications using the Java programming language.<br>
    Download it from: <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>
<li><b>Jakarta ANT 1.4.1 or higher</b><br>
    Ant is a Java based build tool.<br>
    Download it from: <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">http://jakarta.apache.org/</a>
<li><b>Borland C++ Builder 5.5 Command Line Tools</b> for Windows (optional)<br>
    Download it from: <a href="http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html">http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html</a>
</ul>
Additionally Phex uses the following Java librarys which need to be available during the build process. All these librarys can be found in the Phex CVS under <code>/phex/thirdparty</code><br>
<ul>
<li><b>Apache Crimson 1.1.3</b><br>
<li><b>L2FProd Skin Look And Feel 1.2.2</b> (optional)<br>
    SkinLF allows Java developers to write skinnable applications using the Swing toolkit.
</ul>

<h3>The Build Process</h3>
The directory <code>/phex/build</code> contains the build files for the ANT build process. The main build file that is used
to start the build process is <code>/phex/build/build.xml</code>.
You can start the default target <i>buildAll</i> of build process from the Phex home directory with the call:
<blockquote><code>ant -buildfile build\build.xml</code></blockquote>.
To start different targets call: <blockquote><code>ant -buildfile build\build.xml &lt;target-name&gt;</code></blockquote>
<h3>The Build Targets</h3>
The <code>/phex/build/build.xml</code> file contains 7 main build targets. They can be used to build different parts of the Phex build:
<ul>
<li><b>buildAll</b><br>
    This is the default build target that is used when the build process is started without specifying a build target.
    This target will start the targets <i>buildJava</i> and <i>buildNative</i>.<br>
    You can use this target to build the source release.
<li><b>compileAll</b><br>
    This target will start the targets <i>compileJava</i> and <i>buildNative</i>
<li><b>buildJava</b><br>
    This target will compile the Phex Java source, the Skin Look And Feel patch if the Skin Look And Feel library is available, and build the Phex JAR file.
<li><b>compileJava</b><br>
    This target will compile the Phex Java source and the Skin Look And Feel patch if the Skin Look And Feel library is available. This task compiles in debug mode by default. Official releases will have
this flag disabled.
<li><b>buildNative</b><br>
    This target will build the Phex native code for Windows if the Borland C++ Command Line Tools are available.
<li><b>javadoc</b><br>
    This target will generate a Phex Javadoc.
<li><b>run</b><br>
    This target will start <i>buildAll</i> and then starts the build Phex from the output directory.
<li><b>makeRelease</b><br>
    This target should only be used to create a new official release and not to build a current source release. It will start <i>buildAll</i> and then generate a full Phex runtime, source, skin and self-installer release. It also increments the Phex build number.
