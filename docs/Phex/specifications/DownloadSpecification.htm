<h3>SWDownloadWorker</h3>
The download worker is running in a separated thread. It is allocated by the SwarmingManager.<br>
The download worker asks the SwarmingManager to allocate a DownloadSet. A DownloadSet is a working unit with a reference to a download file that has a open segments to download and a download candidate no other SWDownloadWorker has allocated yet.
After allocating the DownloadSet the SWDownloadCandidate associated with the DownloadSet can not be allocated in a DownloadSet anymore.<p>
The SWDownloadWorker is now starting the initialisation process to download from the allocated SWDownloadCandidate in the DownloadSet.<br>
First the SWDownloadWorker tries to connect to the SWDownloadCandidate. Depending on the information of the candidate and the configuration of the local host (firewall) a PUSH request or direkt connection to the host is tried. If direct connection fails a PUSH request might be initialized also.<br>
If the connection failes a error code is assigned to the download candidate, the download set is deallocated and the download worker tries to preceed with the next download segment.<p>
If the connection is successful the process of exchanging the HTTP handshake begins. A free SWDownloadSegment gets allocated from the download file and is passed to the DownloadEngine to exchange the HTTP handshake.
