<h1>The Phex Global Statistic Tracking</h1>
<h4>for Phex 0.X</h4>
<hr>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
The current Phex statistic tracking is very week therefor there will be a completly new statstic tracking concept implemented. The new concept should address the following issues:<br>
<ul>
<li>Offer a easyly extendable way to track any statistic that might come up in the future.
<li>Statistics are displayed to the user in a table.
<li>Allows the user to select the statistics it likes to track/display from a list. Some statistics that are not displayed might not get tracked and others that are not displayed are still tracked. This depends on the type of statistic.
And how expensive the tracking is.
<li>For more performant user interface updates statistics are pooled from the underlying data storage in a defined cycle of 1 to 60 seconds.
</ul>
