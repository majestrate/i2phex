<h1>The Phex Logging</h1>
<h4>for Phex 0.7 and later</h4>
<hr>
For the logging the following keys in your phex.cfg are responsible:
<ul>
<li><b>mLogFile</b><br>
  The complete file name you like to log to.<br>
  e.g.: c:\phex\logOutput.txt<br>
  If not set then the path
  {user.home}/phex/phex.log or {user.home}/.phex/phex.log is used
<li><b>maxLogFileLength</b><br>
  The maximal log file length in bytes. If the file is larger then this size the file is renamed to<br>
  {original file name}.1<br>
  The old backup of the file is overwritten.
<li><b>logToConsole</b><br>
  Activates or deactivate logging to console additionally to file logging.
  Possible values are true or false.<br>
  On Windows logging to console only works when Phex is not started with javaw.
<li><b>loggerVerboseLevel</b><br>
  There are 7 different logger verbose levels. From 0 (finest) to 6 (severe).<br>
  The possible levels are FINEST (0), FINER (1), FINE (2), CONFIG (3), INFO (4), WARNING (5), SEVERE (6)
<li><b>logType</b><br>
  The log type indicates what kind of messages you like to log. The possible types are:<br>
  DOWNLOAD (2), UPLOAD (4), SEARCH (8), NETWORK (16), GUI (32), GLOBAL<br>
  GLOBAL messages are always logged if inside the verbose level. To log the different types just add the numbers.<br>
  e.g.: to log download and network set the log type to 18 (2 + 16) or to log upload, search and gui set the log type to 44 (4 + 8 + 32)
</ul>
