comment: These are songs which I either wrote myself
   or which I like so much, that I simply had to record them.

playlist-name: other songs
comment: These just didn't fit in the other cathegories

list: # we could use any name, or none at all, as it fits us.
  # I would suggest using list, as it doesn't name a file-type.
  # this comment is inside "list" as the "#" is indented by one space.

... # the three dots end a stream/playlist without beginning another one.
# Here the file could end, or you could add
# some additional general information about all the playlists/the MAGMA-file.
# But that information would only be read after the file was processed, 
# I assume,
# so writing those information at the beginning seems more useful to me.
# Still I'm sure there might be uses for this.

# We could also begin anotherstream in here.
# Then the additional information could be added one by one between the 
# playlists (maybe for a live-feed or such).

playlist-name: just some addition
creator-comment: Just wanting to show off, that we could carry 
 far more information with the format extended like this.
list:

  # which makes it part of the "list"

     fan of heart, but to his peril only of his own.
  # this way, MAGMA-Files could be used for far more than just getting  
  # the files. You could send someone a list with the subtitles, which 
  # gets the video itself, either from your local disk or from   
  # filesharing networks.
  # This comment is inside the video-magnet. 
... # End of Stream.

# For the time-field we used the format (in C/C++-syntax): 
# "%dh%dm%ds%dms"
# Means for C: 
# printf("%dh%dm%ds%dms\n", hour, minute, seconds, milliseconds);
