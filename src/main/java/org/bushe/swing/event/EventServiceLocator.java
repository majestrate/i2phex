/**
 * A ServiceLocator pattern class for getting an instance of an EventService. Nothin' fancy, since the EventService is
 * intended for a single VM. Allows mulitple named EventServices to be discovered.
 * <p/>
 * Holds the singleton Swing event service, which is wrapped by the EventBus, which is returned by getSwingEventService
 * and mapped to the service name SERVICE_NAME_EVENT_BUS ("EventBus").  This is not settable.
 * <p/>
 * Since the default EventService implementation is thread safe, and since it's not good to have lots of events on the
 * EventDispatchThread you may want multiple EventServices running on multiple threads, perhaps pulling events from a
 * server and coalescing them into one or more events that are pushed onto the EDT.
 * <p/>
 * The EventServiceLocator is used by the EventBus to locate the implementation of the SwingEventService the EventBus
 * delegates all its calls to.  To change the default implementation class from SwingEventService to your own class,
 * call:
 * <pre>
 * System.setProperty(EventServiceLocator.SWING_EVENT_SERVICE_CLASS, YourEventServiceImpl.class.getName());
 * </pre>
 * Likewise, you can set this on the command line via -Dorg.bushe.swing.event.swingEventServiceClass=foo.YourEventServiceImpl
 *
