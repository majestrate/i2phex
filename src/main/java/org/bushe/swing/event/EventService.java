/**
 * The core interface.  An EventService provides publish/subscribe services to a single JVM using Class-based and
 * String-based (i.e. "topic") publications and subscriptions.
 * <p/>
 * In the class-based pub/sub, Objects are published on an {@link EventService} and (@link EventSubscriber}s subscribe
 * by providing a class or interface. Full class semantics are used, as expected.  That is, if a subscriber subscribes
 * to a class, the subscriber is notified if an object of that class is publish or if an object of a subclass of that
 * class is published. Likewise if a subscriber subscribes to and interface, it will be notified if any object that
 * implements that interface is published.  Subscribers can subscribe "exactly" using {@link #subscribeExactly(Class,
 *EventSubscriber)} so that they are notified only if an object of the exact class is published (and will not be
 * notified if subclasses are published, since this would not be "exact")
 * <p/>
 * In topic-based pub/sub, a data Object is published on a topic name (String).  {@link EventTopicSubscriber}s subscribe
 * to either the exact name of the topic or they may subscribe using a Regular Expression that is used to match topic
 * names.
 * <p/>
 * See package documentation for usage details and examples.
 * <p/>
 * A single subscriber cannot subscribe more than once to an event or topic name.  EventService implementations should
 * handle double-subscription requests by returing false on subscribe().  A single EventSubscriber can subscribe to more
 * than one event class, and a single EventTopicSubscriber can subscribe to more than one topic name or pattern. A
 * single object may implement both EventSubscriber and EventTopicSubscriber interfaces.  Subscribers are guaranteed to
 * only be called for the classes and/or topic names they subscribe to.  If a subscriber subscribes to a topic and to a
 * regular expression that matches the topic name, this is considered two different subscriptions and the subscriber
 * will be called twice for the publication on the topic.  Similarly, if a subscriber subscribes to a class and its
 * subclasses using subscribe() and again to a class of the same type using subscribeExactly(), this is considered two
 * different subscriptions and the subscriber will be called twice for the publication for a single event of the exact
 * type.
 * <p/>
 * By default the EventService only holds WeakReferences to subscribers.  If a subscriber has no references to it, then
 * it can be garbage collected.  This avoids memory leaks in exchange for the risk of accidently adding a listener and
 * have it disappear unexpectedly.  If you want to subscribe a subscriber that will have no other reference to it, then
 * use one of the subscribeStrongly() methods, which will prevent garbage collection.
 * <p/>
 * Unless garbage collected, EventSubscribers will remain subscribed until they are passed to one of the unsubscribe()
 * methods with the event class or topic name to which there are subscribed.
 * <p/>
 * Publication on a class or topic name can be vetoed by a {@link VetoEventListener}. All VetoEventListeners are checked
 * before any EventSubscribers or EventTopicSubscribers are called. This is unlike the JavaBean's
 * VetoPropertyEventListener which can leave side effects and half-propogated events. VetoEventListeners are subscribed
 * in the same manner as EventSubscribers and EventTopicSubscribers.
 * <p/>
 * Subscribers are called in the order in which they are subscribed by default (FIFO).  This is also unlike Swing, where
 * event listeners are called in the reverse order of when they were subscribed (FILO).
 * <p/>
 * This simple example prints "Hello World"
 * <pre>
 * EventService eventService = new ThreadSafeEventService();
 * //Create a subscriber
 * EventTopicSubscriber subscriber = new EventTopicSubscriber() {
 *    public void onEvent(String topic, Object event) {
 *        System.out.println(topic+" "+event);
 *    }
 * });
 * eventService.subscribe("Hello", subscriber);
 * eventService.publish("Hello", "World");
 * System.out.println(subscriber + " Since the reference is used after it is subscribed, it doesn't get garbage
 * collected,
 * this is not necessary if you use subscribeStrongly()");
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Events and/or topic data can be cached, but are not by default.  To cache events or topic data, call
 * #setDefaultCacheSizePerClassOrTopic(int), #setCacheSizeForEventClass(Class, int), or #setCacheSizeForTopic(String,
 * int), #setCacheSizeForTopic(Pattern, int).  Retrieve cached values with #getLastEvent(Class),
 * #getLastTopicData(String), #getCachedEvents(Class), or #getCachedTopicData(String).  Using caching while subscribing
 * is most likely to make sense only if you subscribe and publish on the same thread (so caching is very useful for
 * Swing applications since both happen on the EDT in a single-threaded manner). In multithreaded applications, you
 * never know if your subscriber has handled an event while it was being subscribed (before the subscribe() method
 * returned) that is newer or older than the retrieved cached value (taked before or after subscribe() respectively).
 * <p/>
 * There is nothing special about the term "Event," this could just as easily be called a "Message" Service, this term
 * is already taken by the JMS, which is similar, but is used across processes and networks.
