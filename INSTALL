This is a (brief) guide to compiling and installing Phex from CVS. It is
aimed at people with low(ish) experience with java applications. Please
remember to say if you were using a self-made version of Phex when you report
errors.

Requirements:
- CVS (https://www.cvshome.org/)
- Java 1.4.X (or 1.5.X) SDK (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)

Step 0: install java, ant and CVS
This should be fairly straightforward for the most part.
Make sure your environment variables are set correctly.
ie: JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
ANT_HOME=<path_to_ant>
PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

Step 1: get the Phex source code
Create a directory where the Phex source code is to be stored. From that
directory, execute the following commands:
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phex login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/phex co phex

This should log you into the sourceforge repository and get the current version
of Phex.

(When you want to update this source, simply execute the following from the
Phex directory:
cvs update -dPAC
Warning: this will throw away any changes you made to the source code. If
you want to keep your changes during an update, try 'cvs update -dPA'
)

Step 2: Build Phex
From the phex/build directory, execute:
ant 

This should be sufficient to build Phex.

Step 3: Run Phex
From the phex/output direcoty, execute:
java -jar phex.jar

This should run Phex, using your default configuration. You can use the -c
parameter to specify an alternate configuration directory.

enough or incorrect.
