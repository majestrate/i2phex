to connect to an I2P router over the I2CP protocol,
establish an I2P destination and communicate over I2P.

These files originate from I2P 0.8.6.
Since .jar files are not human readable,
authentication tips follow below.

Authentication tips:
-----------------------------

The package these files were extracted from is found at:
http://mirror.i2p2.de/i2psource_0.8.6.tar.bz2

The public key needed to verify the signature belongs to
"zzz@mail.i2p".

The key fingerprint must be:
4456 EBBE C805 63FE 57E6  B310 4155 76BA A76E 0BED

If something in the above information conflicts internally
or with the package/signature you downloaded for checking,
you should definitely figure out what is wrong,
and until then, not trust these files.
